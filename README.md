# How to use

Install Tampermonkey from here:   
  [https://www.tampermonkey.net/](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)

Visit this URL and copy all the code (if Tampermonkey prompts you to install the script you can skip creating a script manually):  
   [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Penguuuuu/titanic-completion/main/main.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Penguuuuu/titanic-completion/main/main.js)

Create a new tampermonkey script, paste, then save the script

Completion should now show on your profile

# Notes
- The script auto updates whenever tampermonkey does a check (usually once a day)
- for modes other than standard, completion is the sum of all maps for the selected mode and standard
