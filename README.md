# How to use

Install Tampermonkey from one of these links:   
[Firefox](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php?browser=firefox) / [Chrome](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php?browser=chrome)

Visit this URL and copy **ALL** of the code (if Tampermonkey prompts you to install the script, you can skip creating a script manually):  
   [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Penguuuuu/titanic-completion/main/main.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Penguuuuu/titanic-completion/main/main.js)

Create a new tampermonkey script, paste, then save the script

Completion should now show on your profile

# Notes
- The script auto updates whenever tampermonkey does a check (usually once a day)
- For modes other than standard, completion is the sum of all maps for the selected mode and standard
